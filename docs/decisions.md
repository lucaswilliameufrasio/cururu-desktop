# Desktop architecture decisions

## Local Git access

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-08

The desktop client will access local repositories through the embedded Rust
`gix` (gitoxide) library. It will not shell out to the user's `git` executable.
This avoids a runtime dependency on a separately installed Git binary and keeps
repository access behind an app-owned adapter.

Repository discovery, branch inspection, working-tree/index status, and text
diff extraction are read-only: they must not update the index, refs,
configuration, or worktree. UI state and review policy remain in the desktop
app; provider-neutral diff parsing and anchors remain in `cururu-core`. Remote
operations, staging, commits, and other Git mutations are out of scope unless
separately decided.

The app currently pins `gix` 0.85.0 with defaults disabled and the features
needed for local status. This version is used because newer candidates required
an unavailable `gix-dir` release in the configured package index during initial
integration. Review content passes through the core unified-diff parser before
rendering. The first UI entry point is a repository path argument; a native
folder picker remains follow-up work. Text extraction has bounded inputs and
uses Cururu's current default diff limits (45,000 bytes/file, 180,000 total);
binary, symlink, and non-UTF-8 path support remains follow-up work.
